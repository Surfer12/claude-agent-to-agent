## 🔄 Key Migration Patterns Demonstrated

### Your Math Agent Use Case
**OLD (Swarm):**
```python
def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
    # Your existing math function
    pass

math_agent = Agent(
    name="Math Agent",
    instructions="...",
    functions=[calculate]  # OLD: functions parameter
)

client = Swarm()
response = client.run(agent=math_agent, messages=messages)
```

**NEW (Agents SDK):**
```python
@function_tool  # NEW: decorator
def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
    # Your existing math function
    pass

math_agent = Agent(
    name="Math Agent", 
    instructions="...",
    tools=[calculate]  # NEW: tools parameter
)

result = await Runner.run(math_agent, "what is 2+@")
print(result.final_output)
```

### Agent Handoffs (Your Triage System)
**OLD (Swarm):**
```python
def transfer_to_math():
    return math_agent

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="...",
    functions=[transfer_to_math]
)

# Manual tracking required
current_agent = triage_agent
response = client.run(agent=current_agent, messages=messages)
current_agent = response.agent  # Manual tracking
```

**NEW (Agents SDK):**
```python
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="...",
    handoffs=[math_agent]  # NEW: automatic handoffs
)

# No manual tracking needed!
result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "solve 2+2")
# Handoff happens automatically
```

## 🆕 New Features You Get

### 1. **Automatic Handoffs**
- No more manual agent tracking
- Seamless transfers between specialists
- Built-in routing logic

### 2. **Sessions (Conversation Memory)**
- Automatic conversation history
- No manual message management
- Persistent context across turns

### 3. **Tracing & Debugging**
- Built-in run tracking
- Easy debugging and optimization
- Performance monitoring

### 4. **Provider-Agnostic**
- Support for 100+ LLMs
- Not locked into OpenAI
- Flexible model selection

### 5. **Production-Ready Features**
- Guardrails for safety
- Input/output validation
- Error handling improvements

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Set up the environment
chmod +x setup_agents_sdk.sh
./setup_agents_sdk.sh

# 2. Test the migration
python3 test_migration.py

# 3. Run the full demo
python3 migration_to_agents_sdk.py

# 4. Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```
