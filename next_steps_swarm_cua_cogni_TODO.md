It looks like you referenced several directories or projects: `@/swarm`, `@/openai-cua-sample-app`, and `@/openai-java`. Here’s a summary of what’s present and how it relates to your unified agent system work:

---

### 1. **`openai-cua-sample-app`**

This is a sample app for building a Computer Using Agent (CUA) with the OpenAI API. It includes:

- **CLI (`cli.py`)**: Lets you run a CUA agent with different computer environments (local Playwright, Docker, Browserbase, Scrapybara, etc.).
- **Agent Abstraction (`agent/agent.py`)**: Implements an agent loop that interacts with a `Computer` abstraction, handling OpenAI’s computer use tool calls and function calls.
- **Computer Abstractions (`computers/`)**: Modular implementations for different environments (local browser, Docker, Browserbase, Scrapybara, etc.), all following a common interface.
- **Examples**: Demonstrates function calling, custom tools, and weather queries.
- **Dockerfile**: For running a containerized Linux desktop for CUA.
- **README**: Detailed setup, usage, and contribution instructions.

**Key Takeaways for Unification:**
- The `Computer` interface is well-abstracted and supports multiple backends.
- The agent loop is designed to handle both function calls and computer actions, which is essential for a unified system.
- The CLI is flexible and can be adapted for a provider-agnostic unified CLI.

### 2. **`@/swarm` and `@/openai-java`**

You referenced these, but there are no attached files or content for them in the current context. If you want to integrate or reference these projects, please clarify:

- What is the purpose of `@/swarm`? (Is it another agent system, a multi-agent orchestration layer, etc.?)
- What is the role of `@/openai-java`? (Is it a Java client for OpenAI, or something else?)

If you want to merge or interface these with the unified agent system, please provide more details or the relevant code/files.

### **How This Relates to Your Unified System**

- The `openai-cua-sample-app` is a strong foundation for the OpenAI side of your unified agent system, especially for computer use and CLI integration.
- The abstractions here (agent, computer, CLI) can be mapped directly into the provider-agnostic architecture you’re building.
- If you want to unify with other agent systems (like `swarm`) or add Java support (`openai-java`), you’ll need to define clear interfaces or API boundaries.

### **Next Steps / How I Can Help**

- **If you want to merge the OpenAI CUA sample app into your unified agent system:**  
  I can help you map the abstractions, refactor the code, and ensure the CLI and computer use logic are provider-agnostic.
- **If you want to integrate with `swarm` or `openai-java`:**  
  Please provide more details or code, and I can help design the integration.
- **If you want a summary, migration plan, or code samples for any of these tasks:**  
  Let me know your specific goal!

**Please clarify your intent with `@/swarm` and `@/openai-java`, or let me know what you want to do next with the `openai-cua-sample-app`!**
