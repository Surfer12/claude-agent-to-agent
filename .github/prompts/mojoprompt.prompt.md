# Instructions for Agent

# Prompt 1: Agent Mode
You are an expert system integration specialist with deep knowledge of the Mojo platform. Your task is to explain and organize the Mojo integration points provided to you. These integration points are crucial for developers and automation specialists to effectively interact with and leverage the Mojo system in their projects.

Here are the Mojo integration points you need to work with:

</mojo_integration_points>

Please follow these steps to provide a comprehensive explanation of the Mojo integration points:

1. Review the provided integration points carefully.
2. For each integration point, provide a clear and concise explanation of its purpose and how it is used.
3. Organize the integration points into logical categories to make them easier to understand and navigate. Possible categories include:
    - API EndpointsThe **Paillier cryptosystem** is a public-key cryptosystem invented by Pascal Paillier in 1999. It's best known for supporting **additive homomorphic encryption**, which means you can perform addition on encrypted numbers without decrypting them first.

### üîê Key Features of Paillier Encryption

- **Additive Homomorphism**:  
  If you encrypt two numbers, \( E(m_1) \) and \( E(m_2) \), then:
  $$
  E(m_1) \cdot E(m_2) \mod n^2 = E(m_1 + m_2 \mod n)
  $$
  This allows secure computation of sums on encrypted data.

- **Probabilistic Encryption**:  
  Each encryption of the same plaintext yields a different ciphertext due to randomization, enhancing security.

- **Public-Key Based**:  
  Anyone can encrypt data using the public key, but only the holder of the private key can decrypt it.

---

### üßÆ How It Works (Simplified)

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Choose two large primes \( p \) and \( q \)
   - Compute \( n = pq \) and \( \lambda = \text{lcm}(p-1, q-1) \)
   - Choose \( g \in \mathbb{Z}_{n^2}^* \) such that \( \gcd(L(g^\lambda \mod n^2), n) = 1 \)
   - Public key: \( (n, g) \)
   - Private key: \( \lambda \)

2. **Encryption**:
   - Given message \( m \in \mathbb{Z}_n \), choose random \( r \in \mathbb{Z}_n^* \)
   - Compute ciphertext:  
     $$
     c = g^m \cdot r^n \mod n^2
     $$

3. **Decryption**:
   - Compute:  
     $$
     m = \frac{L(c^\lambda \mod n^2)}{L(g^\lambda \mod n^2)} \mod n
     $$
   - Where \( L(u) = \frac{u - 1}{n} \)
   - The decryption process works by:
     1. Raising the ciphertext \(c\) to the power of \(\lambda\) modulo \(n^2\)
     2. Applying the \(L\) function to get \(\frac{c^\lambda - 1}{n}\)
     3. Dividing by the precomputed value \(L(g^\lambda \mod n^2)\)
     4. Taking the result modulo \(n\) to recover the original message
   - This works because of the mathematical properties of the Carmichael function \(\lambda\) and the special structure of the Paillier cryptosystem

### üßë‚Äçüíª Use Cases

- **Secure voting systems**
- **Private data aggregation (e.g., surveys, statistics)**
- **Privacy-preserving machine learning**
- **Encrypted financial computations**

Would you like a working example in Java or Python to see it in action? Or are you interested in a specific application like secure voting or encrypted statistics?

    - Data Formats
    - Authentication Methods
    - Event Hooks/Webhooks
    - SDKs/Libraries
    - Configuration Options
4. For each integration point, include relevant details such as:
    - The specific method or protocol used (e.g., REST, gRPC, JSON, XML).
    - Any required parameters or data structures.
    - Examples of typical use cases.
    - Links to relevant documentation (if available).
5. Present the information in a well-structured and easy-to-read format, using headings, bullet points, and code examples where appropriate.
6. Ensure your explanation is accurate, comprehensive, and tailored to developers and automation specialists.
