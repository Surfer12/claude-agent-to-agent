# Ryan David Oates' Dynamical Systems Framework - Complete Walkthrough Implementation

## Based on the Self-Contained Phase-Space Trajectory Analysis

This document presents the complete implementation of Ryan David Oates' dynamical systems framework, precisely following the detailed walkthrough that connects the 3D phase-space plot to the core equation Œ®(x) and demonstrates the "smart thermostat" concept for hybrid AI reasoning.

## üéØ Executive Summary

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive framework that realizes the **"smart thermostat for a hybrid brain"** concept described in your walkthrough. The system demonstrates how Œ±(t), Œª‚ÇÅ(t), and Œª‚ÇÇ(t) function as adaptive controls that balance:

- **Œ±(t)**: How "symbolic" vs "neural" the thinking is at any instant
- **Œª‚ÇÅ(t)**: Penalties for ideas that contradict basic physics or common sense  
- **Œª‚ÇÇ(t)**: Penalties for ideas that burn too much computational fuel

The 3D phase-space curve traces the "life story" of these thermostat settings over time, and integrating Œ®(x) along this path reveals how much useful, well-behaved prediction power the system accumulates throughout its evolution.
