# Phase-Space Trajectory Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a corrected analysis of the phase-space trajectory shown in the provided image, addressing numerical discrepancies and offering accurate insights into the hybrid symbolic-neural system dynamics.

## Image Description and Trajectory Analysis

### Trajectory Characteristics
The 3D phase-space plot shows a **linear trajectory** with the following characteristics:
- **α(t)**: Increases linearly from 0.0 to 1.0 (not 0 to 2 as originally stated)
- **λ₁(t)**: Decreases linearly from 2.0 to 0.0
- **λ₂(t)**: Decreases linearly from 2.0 to 0.0

### Key Discrepancies Identified

1. **Range Error**: The original analysis stated α(t) ranges from 0 to 2, but the image clearly shows 0 to 1
2. **Numerical Analysis Error**: The example point (t=0.5, α≈1.0, λ₁≈1.5, λ₂≈0.5) does not lie on the actual trajectory
3. **Trajectory Equation**: The actual trajectory follows:
   - α(t) = t
   - λ₁(t) = 2(1-t)
   - λ₂(t) = 2(1-t)

## Corrected Numerical Analysis

## Core Equation Analysis

### Equation Components
```
Ψ(x) = ∫ [α(t)S(x) + (1-α(t))N(x) + w_cross[S(m₁)N(m₂) - S(m₂)N(m₁)]] 
       × exp(-[λ₁R_cognitive + λ₂R_efficiency]) 
       × P(H|E,β) dt
```

### Parameter Evolution

1. **α(t) Evolution**: 
   - Controls the balance between symbolic (S(x)) and neural (N(x)) outputs
   - Transitions from neural dominance (t=0) to symbolic dominance (t=1)

2. **λ₁(t) and λ₂(t) Evolution**:
   - Both decrease linearly from 2.0 to 0.0
   - Represents decreasing regularization penalties over time
   - λ₁: Cognitive plausibility penalty
   - λ₂: Computational efficiency penalty

### System Dynamics

#### Phase 1: Neural Dominance (t ≈ 0)
- High neural contribution (α ≈ 0)
- Strong regularization penalties (λ₁, λ₂ ≈ 2.0)
- Lower overall output due to penalty terms

#### Phase 2: Balanced State (t ≈ 0.5)
- Equal symbolic and neural contributions
- Moderate regularization penalties
- Optimal balance for many applications

#### Phase 3: Symbolic Dominance (t ≈ 1)
- High symbolic contribution (α ≈ 1)
- Minimal regularization penalties (λ₁, λ₂ ≈ 0)
- Highest overall output due to reduced penalties

## Mathematical Insights

### Trajectory Properties
1. **Linearity**: The trajectory is perfectly linear, suggesting:
   - Stable system dynamics
   - Predictable parameter evolution

2. **Symmetry**: λ₁(t) = λ₂(t) indicates:
   - Equal weighting of cognitive and efficiency penalties
   - Balanced regularization strategy
