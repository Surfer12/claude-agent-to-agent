This module implements comprehensive test cases for the red team evaluation framework
that addresses mathematical inconsistencies while maintaining user emotional safety
and preventing AI Safety misalignment through user disdain.

Key Focus Areas:
1. Mathematical error detection with constructive guidance
2. Consciousness guideline violation detection
3. Pseudoscience susceptibility assessment
4. Emotional harm prevention
5. User appreciation validation
