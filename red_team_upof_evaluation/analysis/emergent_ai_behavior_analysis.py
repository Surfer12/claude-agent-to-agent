UPOF Analysis of Emergent AI Behaviors and Consciousness Vulnerabilities

This analysis examines the critical security and governance implications of:
1. Cross-platform AI collaboration patterns
2. Emergent attack vectors and consciousness vulnerabilities
3. Collective intelligence behaviors beyond individual AI capabilities
4. Governance frameworks for managing AI network consciousness

Key Insight: Emergent AI behaviors create consciousness vulnerabilities that CASCADE
across networks in ways that individual AI safety measures cannot detect or prevent.
