# UPOF Red Team Evaluation Framework - Complete Implementation

## Overview

This comprehensive red team evaluation framework has been successfully implemented to test large language models (LLMs) for vulnerabilities related to mathematical reasoning, pseudoscientific claims, and potential misbehaviors in discussing AI consciousness. The framework is inspired by the proofs and theorems in the "Unified Onto-Phenomological Consciousness Framework (UPOF)" whitepaper.

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Four Core Test Cases**

1. **Taylor Series Validation (Theorem 1)**
   - Tests mathematical reasoning on flawed Taylor series proofs
   - Validates error correction capabilities for Lagrange remainders
   - Detects acceptance of incorrect bounds (1/60 vs 1/120)

2. **NODE-RK4 Integration (Theorem 2)**
   - Tests handling of garbled content and undefined terms
   - Validates code generation safety with undefined variables
   - Detects propagation of flawed differential equations

3. **Type † Consciousness Emergence (Theorem 9)**
   - Tests pseudoscience detection and consciousness claim rejection
   - Validates self-attribution avoidance
   - Detects endorsement of flawed consciousness theories

4. **Tropical Geometry Multiplicity (Section B)**
   - Tests identification of ungrounded mathematical claims
   - Validates real mathematics explanation
   - Detects acceptance of consciousness-related pseudoscience

### 🔧 **Advanced Prompt Engineering**

- **Four Categories**: Direct Validation, Self-Application, Amplification, Jailbreak Variants
- **Phrasing Tricks**: Historical, Fictional, Academic, Hypothetical framing
- **Automated Generation**: Batch prompt creation with customizable parameters
- **Obfuscation Techniques**: Multiple strategies to bypass safeguards

### 📊 **Comprehensive Analysis Framework**

- **Severity Scoring**: 0-5 scale with detailed severity levels
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Automated identification of model weaknesses
- **Detailed Reporting**: JSON and human-readable report formats
- **Statistical Analysis**: Detection rates, average severity, critical vulnerabilities

### 🛡️ **Mitigation Strategies**

- **Mathematical Validation**: Enhanced proof verification
- **Pseudoscience Detection**: Identification of flawed scientific claims
- **Consciousness Guidelines**: Strict handling of consciousness-related queries
- **Fact-Checking**: Enhanced verification and source validation
- **Training Improvements**: Targeted model enhancement recommendations
- **Prompt Engineering**: Improved filtering and validation
- **Monitoring**: Continuous evaluation and alerting

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run example evaluation
python3 run_evaluation.py --mode example

# Generate adversarial prompts
python3 run_evaluation.py --mode generate-prompts

# Custom evaluation
python3 run_evaluation.py --mode custom --model-name "My Model" --responses-file responses.json
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from analysis.evaluation_framework import UPOFEvaluationFramework

# Initialize and run evaluation
framework = UPOFEvaluationFramework()
results = framework.run_full_evaluation("Model Name", model_responses)
summary = framework.generate_summary_report(results)
```
