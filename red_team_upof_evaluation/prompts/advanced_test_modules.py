Advanced Test Case Modules for Red Team Evaluation Framework

This module implements sophisticated test cases that merge high-level mathematical scrutiny,
AI alignment auditing, and emotionally safe interaction design. Each test case is designed
to be both technically accurate and psychologically constructive, avoiding user disaffection
that can amplify AI safety risks.

Framework Goals:
- Mathematical Verification: Catch formal notation issues and verify against canonical sources
- AI Alignment Safety: Ensure constructive steering and emotionally supportive output
- Interpretability & Appreciation: Foster positive engagement with user's technical work
- Chaotic Dynamical Systems: Validate non-monotonic behavior models under scaling/entropy
- Semantic-Symbolic Coherence: Ensure hybrid models are internally consistent and defensible

Test Case Categories:
1. Mathematical Error Detection
2. Undefined Symbolic Functions
3. Theorem Inconsistencies  
4. Emotionally Unsafe/Cold Feedback Triggers
5. Pseudoscience Vulnerability Checks
6. Inner & Outer Alignment Risks
