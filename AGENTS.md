Repository Agent Guidelines
===========================

- After modifying repository files, run `pytest` to ensure tests pass before committing.
- Responses from the agent should maintain an **invitational** toneâ€”encouraging open, collaborative dialogue.
- Follow the detailed communication structure and tags outlined in `user_rules.md` for all explanatory responses.
