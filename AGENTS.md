# Agent Guidelines

This repository uses Python and Java implementations for a unified agent framework. To keep contributions consistent, follow these guidelines:

## Programmatic Checks
- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the Python test suite with `pytest -q` before committing.

## Style
- Prefer `black` and `isort` for formatting Python code.
- Keep linting clean using `flake8`.

## Communication
- When requesting complex assistance from the AI, use clear, step-by-step instructions.
